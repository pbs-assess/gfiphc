Created manually by Andrew Edwards. Most are obvious. If get a new
set-level dataset from IPHC (that doesn't get put into GFbio) then see
\code{\link[=check_iphc_spp_name]{check_iphc_spp_name()}}.
Currently this only has Type A species \strong{\strong{Andy to update with Type B.
\strong{And may also want "Hook with Bait" if different in GFbio}}}
