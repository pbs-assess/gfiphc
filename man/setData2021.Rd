earlier years)}
\item{effSkateIPHC}{effective skate number of the set, as calculated by IPHC}
\item{E_it20}{effective skate number of the set based on the first 20 hooks
only, calculated as the (number of hooks observed)/
(number of hooks retrieved) * effSkateIPHC}
\item{usable}{whether or not the set is usable, as determined by IPHC}
\item{standard}{whether or not the station is a standard station or in the
expanded grid}
\item{hooksRetr}{number of hooks retrieved for that set}
\item{hooksObs}{number of hooks observed for that set (already used to
calculate \code{E_it20}, but saving anyway)}
