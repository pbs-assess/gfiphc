This vignette shows how to extract and analyse the data for a single
species. Since the extraction from the GFBio database only works for users on
the Pacific Biological Station network that have permission to access the
database, an example data set for Yelloweye Rockfish is included in the
package.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, results = FALSE}
library(gfiphc)
library(dplyr)    # To print tibble properly
```

## Data for species of interest

Define common species name:
```{r species}
sp <- "yelloweye rockfish"
sp_short_name <- "Yelloweye"  # short name for legends
```

Someone at PBS has to run the next chunk of code to extract data from
the GFBio database and send the external collaborator the resulting .rds file,
which will have the format `species-name.rds`, e.g. `longnose-skate.rds`. As an
example, the data for Yelloweye Rockfish have been extracted and included as
data in the package. Hence this chunk is not evaluated for this vignette:
```{r extract, eval = FALSE}
# This chunk will only work within PBS
cache_pbs_data_iphc(sp)
                                       # That creates species-name. [This is
                                       #  what gfsynopsis::get_data_iphc() calls,
                                       #  via gfsynopsis::get_data() in
                                       #  report/make.R of gfsynopsis repo.]
```

Once an external person has the `species-name.rds` file, the two lines in the
next chunk can be appropriately commented/uncommented to load the data. For this
vignette we will use the Yelloweye Rockfish data included in the package.
```{r loadrds}
# Comment this out to analyse non-yelloweye data:
sp_set_counts <- yelloweye_rockfish

# Uncomment this to analyse non-yelloweye data:
# sp_set_counts <- readRDS(paste0(gsub(" ", "-", sp), ".rds"))
```

## Details for all skates and stations, and hooks returned with bait

Other data sets are already built into the gfiphc package, the main ones are
given here.

Locations and effective skate values of stations for the 1995 survey:
```{r builtin}
setData1995
```

Counts of each species at each station in 1995:
```{r builtin2}
countData1995
```

Catches at each station from 1996 to 2002:
```{r builtin3}
data1996to2002
```

Station details for 2013 survey:
```{r builtin4}
setData2013
```

Station details for 2020 survey:
```{r builtin5}
setData2020
```

Station details regarding expansion stations from 2018 (and some later years):
```{r builtin6}
setDataExpansion
```

The following data sets are extracted from GFBio but extracted at PBS and then included
in the package (using `data-raw/sets-skates-hooks-yelloweye.R`), which will be
run each year to update the data objects.

Station details from GFBio for years not mentioned above:
```{r builtinfromgfbio}
sets_other_years
```

Skate-level details from GFBio (though such data are not available for years for
which data are only available at the set-by-set level):
```{r builtinfromgfbio2}
skates_other_years
```

Counts of hooks returned with bait on them, for each set, for all years (note it
is a list containing one tibble):
```{r builtinfromgfbio3}
hooks_with_bait
```

Counts of Yelloweye Rockfish on each set for all years (note it is a list containing one tibble):
```{r builtinfromgfbio4}
yelloweye_rockfish
```

See `?<dataset>` for details of each, and `data(package = "gfiphc")` for other
data sets. Notation such as `E_it20` matches the write-up in the Groundfish
Synopsis report.

The formats are different to each other due to the data that are
available. For example, there are no `hooksObserved` values available for 1995
and 2013, which will complicate consideration of hook competition
for those years. `setDataExpansion` is needed to identify stations in the expanded
grid (that were not fished in previous years).

Look at the data for the species of interest, which combines all the data for
the species (built-in data sets plus data extracted from GFBio):
```{r load}
sp_set_counts
                  # For each set, the calculatable catch rates for that
                  #  species, plus lat and lon and whether the set is usable.
                  # Includes the basic information for each set, with further
                  #  details in the objects mentioned above.
                  # See ?get_all_iphc_set_counts for full details.

tail(sp_set_counts$set_counts)

summary(sp_set_counts$set_counts)
```

## Maps of stations

For a single year, and whether or not the survey caught the species of interest
in that year:

```{r onemap, fig.height = 6}
plot_iphc_map(sp_set_counts$set_counts,
              sp_short_name = sp_short_name,
              years = 2008)
```

For the most recent year of data (see below for discussion):
```{r latestyear, fig.height = 6}
plot_iphc_map(sp_set_counts$set_counts,
              sp_short_name = sp_short_name,
              years = max(sp_set_counts$set_counts$year))
```

Unusable stations are determined by the IPHC and any data are excluded from our
calculations. The horizontal line is the cut-off for calculations for different
Series (see the synopsis Research Document). Note that the `sp_short_name`
argument is only for the legend, the first argument needs to contain the data
for the species of interest.

To see a movie of the station locations through time:

![IPHC-stations-movie-1995-2020.gif](IPHC-stations-movie-1995-2020.gif).

Here is the code to build the movie, but it is commented out since it causes Travis
to fail (Travis is the continuous integration service that automatically
checks the packages builds every time a change is committed to GitHub, giving the
little green symbol `passing` icon on the main page). To make the movie, run the
run this vignette code with commented line uncommented (you need to install the
`gifski` package), right-click on the animation in the
html viewer and save it with the above filename.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# ```{r, animation.hook = 'gifski', interval = 1.5, fig.height = 6}
for(i in unique(sp_set_counts$set_counts$year)){
  plot_iphc_map(sp_set_counts$set_counts,
                sp_short_name = sp_short_name,
                years = i)
}
```

To see the stations without reference to any species:
```{r, fig.height = 6}
plot_iphc_map(sp_set_counts$set_counts,
              sp = NULL,
              years = 2008)
```

noting that you still need `sp_set_counts$set_counts` (for an arbitrary species)
as an argument.

Can also use `hooks_with_bait$set_counts` to see stations that came back with no
bait (the legend will need adapting though; empty circles are no baits with
hooks returned):
```{r, fig.height = 6}
plot_iphc_map(hooks_with_bait$set_counts,
              sp = "Hooks with bait",
              years = 2008)
```

## Expanded survey grid in 2018 and 2020

In the above movie you see that the number of sets jumped in 2018 and 2020 due to the expanded
survey grid that year that involved sets at extra stations:
```{r plotsets, fig.height = 4}
sets_each_year <- sp_set_counts$set_counts %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total = n())

plot(sets_each_year$year, sets_each_year$total, type = "o",
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "Sets each year", ylim = c(0, max(sets_each_year$total)))
```

The extra stations are identified as `standard` being `N`, with `Y` being the
standard stations (see `data-raw/iphc-2020-data.R` for explanation of why we
changed the values for some stations from the IPHC raw data). Removing the
non-standard stations brings the number of sets in 2018 and 2020 into line with
other years, and so this should be done for (most) analyses:
```{r plotsetsstd, fig.height = 4}
sets_each_year_standard <- sp_set_counts$set_counts %>%
  filter(standard == "Y") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total = n())

plot(sets_each_year_standard$year, sets_each_year_standard$total, type = "o",
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "Sets each year", ylim = c(0, max(sets_each_year$total)))
```

Note that the expansion (non-standard) stations only
appear in recent years:
```{r checkexpansion}
filter(sp_set_counts$set_counts, standard == "N") %>%
  select(year) %>%
  range()
```

So use `filter(..., standard == "Y", usable == "Y")` for analyses (to also include
only the usable stations).

## Calculate longest time series possible for the full coast

In Appendix G of the synopsis report we described analyses to calculate as long
a time series as possible by combining data from years when only the first 20 hooks
were enumerated for each skate (Series A) with data from years when all hooks could be enumerated
from each skate (Series B); there are overlapping years when all hooks were
enumerated and the data are available at the hook-by-hook level. The resulting
Series AB applies only to the area north of WCVI, but was tested to see if it was
representative of the whole coast by also calculating Series C and D.

The function `calc_iphc_full_res()` does all the calculations in one step and
saves all the output. See `?calc_iphc_full_res` for full details of the output,
but basically `$ser_longest` is the longest time series that can be made for the
species, with `$full_coast` indicating whether it can be considered
representative of the full coast. Series A, B, C, and D are also given, along
with geometric means and the test results comparing scaled series.

```{r serABCD}
series_ABCD_full <- calc_iphc_full_res(sp_set_counts$set_counts)
series_ABCD_full
```

Now plot Series A and B and show their scaled versions and the resulting Series
AB (bottom right), which is the longest series available and is considered
applicable to the whole coast if `series_ABCD_full$full_coast` is `TRUE`:
```{r serplot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
plot_IPHC_ser_four_panels_ABCD(series_ABCD_full,
                               sp = sp)
series_ABCD_full$type
series_ABCD_full$full_coast
```

There is a wrapper function, HERE `iphc_get_calc_plot(sp)`,  NOT FULLY DONE YET,
base it on area one and mention at the start of this vignette.

Note that the code may not yet fully account for all possibilities
for the different Series, particularly for rarer species
with, by definition, low count numbers. So do check that the output is
sensible. The code may calculate a longest series, but it may not be
ecologically useful.


## Not running yet, can ignore for now:

Robyn did this for Pacific Cod (but will not get 2018 right since code doesn't
yet correct for expansion stations). This was to take a quick look at the data,
but she didn't end up using it. Will be useful as an example here.

```{r pcod, eval = FALSE}
iphc_raw <- gfiphc::tidy_iphc_survey(
  get_iphc_hooks("pacific cod"),
  get_iphc_skates_info(),
  get_iphc_sets_info()
)
iphc_index <- gfiphc::calc_iphc_full_res(iphc_raw)
```


The code used in `gfsynopsis/R/make-pages.R` is the following, simplifying it
here to then check that it matches what is done above (not finished checking yet):
```{r gfsynopsis, eval = FALSE}
#if (!is.null(dat_iphc)) {
#    if (!file.exists(iphc_index_cache_spp)) {
      iphc_set_counts_sp <-
        gfiphc::calc_iphc_full_res(dat_iphc$set_counts)

      saveRDS(iphc_set_counts_sp, file = iphc_index_cache_spp, compress = FALSE)
    } else {
      iphc_set_counts_sp <- readRDS(iphc_index_cache_spp)
    }

    iphc_set_counts_sp_format <- tryCatch({
      gfiphc::format_iphc_longest(iphc_set_counts_sp)
    }, error = function(e) NA)
    # Remove existing (GFbio) based IPHC series with longer ones from new calcs
    if (!is.na(iphc_set_counts_sp_format)) {
      dat_tidy_survey_index <- dat_tidy_survey_index %>%
        filter(survey_abbrev != "IPHC FISS") %>%
        rbind(iphc_set_counts_sp_format)
    }
  }
```

## Extracting multiple species (not run here)

Did these for Joe Watson (16/12/20). May as well document here as will need to
do again when the 2020 data are uploaded. Realised can just make a species vector
so doing that here, though not fully tested.

```{r multiple, eval=FALSE}
sp_vec <- c("yelloweye rockfish",
            "arrowtooth flounder",
            "lingcod",
            "north pacific spiny dogfish",
            "pacific cod",
            "pacific halibut",
            "redbanded rockfish",
            "sablefish",
            "longnose skate",
            "walleye pollock")

cache_pbs_data_iphc(sp_vec)   # not double checked, as just ran them all individually

# Do in console to just print the first and last values:
for(sp in sp_vec){
  print(sp)
  print(readRDS(paste0(gsub(" ", "-", sp), ".rds")))
  print(tail(readRDS(paste0(gsub(" ", "-", sp), ".rds"))$set_counts))
}
```
